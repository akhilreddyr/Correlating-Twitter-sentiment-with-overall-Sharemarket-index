# Correlating-Twitter-sentiment-with-overall-Sharemarket-index
Abstract : 
This project is about predicting the share market rise or fall by analyzing the twitter sentiment. 
Here, we take the 2020 election data set and analyze the effect of positive and negative polls on the share market. We have taken Biden and Donald Trumpâ€™s data set and correlate the effect of their individual polls with the share market.
We just predict the rise or fall of the share market and not its share price.

Introduction :
Sentiment analysis is a common NLP task, which involves classifying texts or parts of texts into a pre-defined sentiment. We use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), a commonly used NLP library in Python, to analyze textual data.
 The Twitter data is correlated with the stock market index and the effects of the stock market are predicted and analysed.
A large amount of data that is generated today is unstructured, which requires processing to generate insights. Some examples of unstructured data are news articles, posts on social media, and search history. The process of analyzing natural language and making sense out of it falls under the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Here we analyse Twitter data and correlate it with the stock market index.
